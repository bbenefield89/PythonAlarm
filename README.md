[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) [![Python 3.6, 3.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

## The problem
`Pylarm` is the definitetion of "set it and forget it".

You need a quick and easy way of keeping track of the time but you're too lazy to set an alarm on your phone and to be completely honest, isn't it just a lot easier to type `pylarm` into your terminal and forget about it?


## This solution
With easy commands right at your finger tips `Pylarm` aims to cure you of overcooked rice on the stove or playing a video game for FAR too long.

## Installation
This module is not distributed on any package manager and therefore must currently be installed directly via GitHub. You can either download the ZIP file or in your terminal run

**SSH**: `git clone git@github.com:bbenefield89/PythonAlarm.git`  
**HTTPS**: `git clone https://github.com/bbenefield89/PythonAlarm.git`

## Usage
After downloading this module you can choose to either run this manually everytime from the root directory: `$ <path>/PythonAlarm/src/main.py` or set up an alias in your `.bashrc` to quickly running this module from anywhere.

After starting up this module you will be prompted with a message `What time: `. Just input your time **without** a meridiem, A.M. or P.M., and let Pylarm do its job.

**Example**:  
`$ python <path>/PythonAlarm/src/main.py`  
`What time: 3:30`

<div style="display: none">
  **(Coming Soon)** After downloading this module simply navigate to the root directory of this module and run `python setup.py`. From now on, from any directory, you should be able to run `pylarm` to start the alarm.

## Inspiration
My own inability to remember to set alarms for *ANYTHING*, also all the overcooked rice in my life.
